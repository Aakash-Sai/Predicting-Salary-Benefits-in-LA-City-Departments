## Project Overview 
* Salary Benefits for employees is a crucial aspect of compensation which is what I tried to predict. Salary benefits is subdivided into Health Cost, Dental Cost & Life Cost.
* Key predictors such as Permanent Bonus Pay & Q1 Payments caught me by surprise.
* Also predicting Basic Life Cost, a component of total benefits for employees, is valuable because it often goes overlooked in comparison to more emphasized benefits like health coverage.
