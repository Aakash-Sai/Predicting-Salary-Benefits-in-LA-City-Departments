## Project Overview 
I have chosen to work on a dataset that contains City Payroll Information for all Los Angeles city departments. These departments are the ones that work for the city and do not involve any private organizations. The dataset includes a variety of variables, such as job titles, salaries, bonuses, and benefit costs. 

In this project, I am particularly intrigued by the predictive power of various factors on the Benefit Costs and Basic Life insurance coverage of employees that work for LA. I also wanted to use more statistical methods in this project which helped me learn a lot about them.

**The Data Story PDF file above gives a great overview of the project.


## Some thoughts
* Salary Benefits for employees is a crucial aspect of compensation which is what I tried to predict. Salary benefits is subdivided into Health Cost, Dental Cost & Life Cost.
* Key predictors such as Permanent Bonus Pay & Q1 Payments caught me by surprise.
* Also predicting Basic Life Cost, a component of total benefits for employees, is valuable because it often goes overlooked in comparison to more emphasized benefits like health coverage.


## Tools & Technologies Used
* R Language (Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, caTools, GGally, MASS)
* Jupyter Notebook
